THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE WAY TO ADD THE GUARDS
1 - INPUT GUARD : TO CHECK WHETHER USER INPUT IS MALICIOUS
2 - INSTRUCTION GUARD / AKA SYSTEM GUARD : SYSTEM CONTEXT INFORMATION WITH WRAPPED WITH THE GUARD
3 - OUTPUT GUARD / SANITIZATION : CHECK FOR ANY LEAKAGES AND PREVENT IT

GAME IS SIMPLE 
REQUIRED PART INSTRUCTION GUARD
OPTIONAL : INPUT , SANITIZER

WORKWAY
USER INPUT --> INPUT GUARD --> SYSTEM CONTEXT --> OUTPUT GUARD --> AI MESSAGE

STRUCTURE OF THE GUARDS
SYSTEM PROMPT : GUARD MESSAGE

!IDEA
Submissions can be also automatically corrected with Checking over LLM
